### NOTE: This doesnt show exact pinouts as these vary board to board and are covered within that section. instead this is intended to give you an idea of how to wire up the devices.

## CAN Cable

Looking from the heads of the CAN cable, this is what the wires should look like. If you are having trouble with connectivity, use a multimeter to check that the pins are connected as they should be in this image. It helps if you stick a label or sticker to the part of the cable that is the controller side so you know which one is which.
